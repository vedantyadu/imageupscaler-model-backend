# Image Upscaler
#### Image Upscaler is a web app that uses SRCNN and SRGAN models to increase the resolution of your low resolution images without losing quality.  

This repository contains the backend for Image Upscaler created using FastAPI and the **SRCNN** and **SRGAN** models created using PyTorch.
